App:
Python 3.7
Flask 1.0.2
requests 2.22.0
CSS/HTML5
Bootstrap as an additional CSS resource.

To do:
Currency input. The API supports it I just have it reading in '1' as the value.

Updates:
Having issues getting input properly read from the index template. New API as the others I found don't allow for custom input and limit requests etc.

To get your local git working again:
 pip install flask (if you haven't already)
 pip install requests

 python convertapp.py
