Python 3.7</br>
Flask 1.0.2</br>
requests 2.22.0</br>
CSS/HTML5</br>
Bootstrap as an additional CSS resource.

To do:</br>
Currency input. The API supports it I just have it reading in '1' as the value.

Updates:</br>
Having issues getting input properly read from the index template. New API as the others I found don't allow for custom input and limit requests etc.

To get your local git working again:</br>
 pip install flask (if you haven't already)</br>
 pip install requests

 python convertapp.py
